          <h3 class="card-title">Concept</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            The Concept we came up with was creating a 3D Art Exhibtion. Created
            on a simple website. the reason behind this was because Lando &
            Maxim came up with the idea, based of an inspiration they found when
            they were exploring different ideas and the stumbled upon ThreeJS
            and the possibilities that came with ThreeJS. So the concept itself
            is an Art Exhibition room where u can interact with different 3D Art
            models.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">ThreeJS</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            So as said in our concept we used ThreeJS to create out Art Room. We
            wont go in depth on each attribute and how we used it, but to
            explain shortly. ThreeJS is a javascript pluggin so trough coding u
            can get a variety of different results. You can animate a variety of
            different effects but we used it to create our pedestals, make the
            3D models move up and down and every little animation and effect is
            all due to JS or ThreeJs. This job was for Maxim.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3 class="card-title">P5</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            We used P5 for the animated background that u can see on our
            homepage. We went looking for a variety of different interactions
            and animations that could have made our website more interesting but
            in the end we landed on this because we felt like it added to the
            abstract part of our webiste. It also has a tiny hidden interactive
            feature, in which u can press the "S" button on your homepage and in
            doing so u will create screenshot. All of the P5 coding and
            adjustments were lando his job, As also everything u can seen on the
            home page. For example the intro and interactions.
